      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Corey Foshee, and I have served in a leadership role in the local church for 13 years.
        I genuinely believe that the local church is the hope of the world, and I love to be able to use my passion for leadership and technology to bring that hope to the world.
        I have served in churches of all sizes, from one of the largest churches in America to a small church plant in rural Alabama, and I have found one thing to be true:
        you can build a healthy team no matter where you are and no matter how many people attend your church.
      </p>

      <p>I currently serve at One Hope Church in New Orleans, LA, where I had the opportunity to help build a successful production team
      from the ground up and develop ministry relationships with other production team leaders across the nation.
      My dream is to see church leaders go from the person who serves every Sunday to the person who is equipping
      and empowering the people in their church to make a difference using their God-given gifts.
      </p>
