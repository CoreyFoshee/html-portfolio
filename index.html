        <p class="about"> My name is Corey Foshee, and I have served in a leadership role in the local church for 13 years.
        I genuinely believe that the local church is the hope of the world, and I love to be able to use my passion for leadership and technology to bring that hope to the world.
        I have served in churches of all sizes, from one of the largest churches in America to a small church plant in rural Alabama, and I have found one thing to be true:
        you can build a healthy team no matter where you are and no matter how many people attend your church.
